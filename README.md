## Overview 

### About the project

This is a landing page of my Final Project Course. The application consists in a mobile app that is an emergency button, named BAH Socorro (Botão de Ajuda Humanitária/(English: Humanitarian Assistance Button). This button aims to help individuals victims of domestic violence, racial or gender discrimination, women victims of harassment or violence, etc. We hope with this app give a support for those people and improve their lives using the technology and applying the knowledges obtained during the course of Senac. Each time the individual be in a danger situation, he might press the button and an emergency message will be sent to the authorities and other contacts stored in the app. The app also will be displayed with a different layout, covered in the victim's cellphone. If someone take the victim's cell phone, this person won't find the app there, because the app will be disguised.
